6 Ingredients
180 Minutes
700 Calories

1 turkey
230 ml orange juice
70 g salt
2 tbs brown sugar
12 leaves fresh sage
4 tbs unsalted butter

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the orange juice, salt and brown sugar. Bring to a boil and boil for 5 minutes, stirring to dissolve. Transfer to a glass bowl and nestle the bowl in a larger one filled halfway with ice and water. Let cool completely. Transfer half of the mixture to a blender and blend on high speed for 1 minute. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl. Repeat with the remaining mixture. Set aside.

Preheat an oven to 425ºF.

Rinse the turkey inside and out with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Place the turkey, breast side up, on a rack in a large roasting pan. Gently slide your fingers under the breast to loosen the skin and insert about 12 large sage leaves, spacing them evenly. Place the remaining sage sprigs in the body cavity. Truss the turkey if desired.

Brush the turkey with the melted butter and season with salt. Roast for 30 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350ºF. Continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast, away from the bone, registers 165ºF and the thigh registers 175ºF, about 2 1/2 hours more. 

Transfer the turkey to a carving board, cover loosely with foil and let rest for 20 minutes before carving. Reserve 2 Tbs. of the pan drippings for the gravy. To make the gravy, pour the turkey gravy base into a saucepan. Whisk in the pan drippings. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low and keep warm until ready to serve. Carve the turkey and arrange on a warmed platter. Transfer the gravy to a warmed sauceboat and pass alongside.

4 Ingredients
55 Minutes
550 Calories

2 tbs salt
4 potatoes
1 L water
10 g peanut oil

In a large bowl, mix the salt into the warm water until dissolved.

Cut the potatoes lengthwise into 1/2 inch thick strips. Cut each slice into 1/4 inch thick fries. Place the fries into the salted water and allow to soak for 15 minutes.

Line a large baking sheet with towels and set aside. Fill a deep pot with about 10 grams of peanut oil. Heat to 375ºF. Remove the cut potatoes from the water and thoroughly pat dry. Add the fries to the heated oil in batches, being careful not to overcrowd. Cook just until starting to brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer using a slotted spoon or tongs to the towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining fries.

Once all the fries have been cooked, return the oil to 375ºF. Add the first set of cooked fries and fry until golden and crisp, 1-2 minutes. Remove to towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining fries.

8 Ingredients
35 Minutes
730 Calories

0.55 kg broccoli
230 g bacon
240 g mayonnaise
3 tbs honey
10 g salt
2.5 tbs apple cider vinegar
30 g dried cranberries
50 g red onion

Mix all dressing ingredients in a bowl. In a mixing bowl whisk together mayonnaise, honey, apple cider vinegar and season with salt to taste. Dressing can be made up to 1 week in advance, store in refrigerator in an airtight container.

Heat oven to 400ºF. Line baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place bacon in a single layer on baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until cooked through, about 12 – 16 minutes (cook time can vary based on thickness of bacon). Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain and cool, then chop.

Toss together all salad ingredients with dressing. Add broccoli, bacon, cranberries and red onions to a salad bowl. Pour dressing mixture over the top and toss to evenly coat.

Salad can be served right away or let the flavors meld in the fridge 1 hour if you have time.



Roast Beef

5 Ingredients
70 Minutes
770 Calories

1.4 kg beef
1 tbs oil
3 cloves garlic
30 g salt
30 g black pepper

Start with your roast at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 375ºF. With a sharp knife, make a tiny slit in the meat just large enough to slide a sliver of garlic into the meat. Repeat all over the roast, for each sliver of garlic. Drizzle olive oil on the roast and rub all over the sides. Sprinkle the entire roast with salt and pepper. Place the roast directly on the oven rack, fatty side up, with a drip pan on a rack underneath the roasting rack.

Brown the roast at 375ºF for 30 minutes. Lower the heat to 225ºF. Cook the roast another 2-3 hours. When the roast begins to drip juices and has turned brown on the outside, check the temperature with a meat thermometer. Carefully use tongs to remove the roast from the oven when the inside temperature is 140ºF. Let the roast rest on a plate, tented with foil to keep warm, for at least 15 minutes before carving to serve.



Fried Chicken

1.8 kg chicken tenders
0.70 L buttermilk
250 g flour
0.5 tbs salt
0.5 tbs sweet paprika
0.5 tbs black pepper
0.5 tbs garlic powder
vegetable oil

Toss the chicken, buttermilk and salt in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for about 1 hour.

Heat 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large deep skillet (or in a deep fryer) over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360ºF.

Mix the flour and spices in a shallow bowl. Remove one tender from the buttermilk, shake off the excess and roll in the flour mixture. Shake off the excess flour and lay on a plate. Repeat the process until all pieces of chicken are double coated.

Place chicken into the hot oil and fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
